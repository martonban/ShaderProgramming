# Shader Programming (WIP)

**IMPORTATNT: THIS README IS NOT READY AT ALL!!!** <br />
This repository is contain shader programming projects I did. The porojects can be pretty diverse in the aspect of technology and purpose. You can create a lot's of shaders with a wide variety of tools like SHADERed, shadertoy, Unity, Godot or Unreal. On the ather hand a project can be more artistic like a tech art project or it can be more technical such as a volumetric rendering. <br />

This repository is mainly technical. So I am going to create code in GLSL, HLSL in SHADERed and in Unity. If you interested in more atistic projects of mine please feel free to check my ather repository called [LittleTechnicalArtProjects](https://github.com/martonban/LittleTechnicalArtProjects). 

# Browsing Projects
After this paragraph you can see the catalog. If you like a project you can find out more informations about it. I will provide information how you can start the live demo and find resourses what I used under the development. If the project is complicated or I heavily rely on a tutorial/article I am going to make a explanatory article about that project.
