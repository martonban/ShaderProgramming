# Shader Programming
This repository primarily contains my smaller shader programming projects. The main concept is that the GLSL shaders in Godot lean more toward technical art, the node-based projects in Blender are more artistically oriented, while the OSL projects are mostly experimental. HLSL is the only one that follows a consistent theme: it contains my solutions from the Shader Learning platform, which can be viewed in the application called ShaderED.
