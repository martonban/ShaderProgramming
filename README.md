# [WIP] Shader Programming
This repository contains shader programming projects that I have completed. The projects vary in terms of technology and purpose. A wide range of shaders can be created using various tools, such as SHADERed, Shadertoy, Unity, Godot, or Unreal Engine. On the other hand, some projects are more artistic in nature, such as tech art, while others are more technical, such as volumetric rendering <br />

This repository is primarily technical. I will be creating code in GLSL, HLSL, using SHADERed ,Unity or Godot. If you are interested in more artistic projects of mine, please feel free to explore my other repository, titled [LittleTechnicalArtProjects](https://github.com/martonban/LittleTechnicalArtProjects). 

# Fundamentals
In the next section, you can see the smaller shader programming demos that demonstrate fundamental concepts.
